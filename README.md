# gdi-revealjs-project

Like the GDI class slides? They may look like powerpoint, but really they are just HTML, CSS and a little bit of Javascript that use a framework called RevealJS that makes clever use of styling and transitions to simulate the look and feel of powerpoint.

The definitive guide for how to use RevealJS is here: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/

And if you don't want to build your own, but rather just use this presentation framework, check out http://slides.com/

But if you'd like to make your own RevealJS slides, use this project as a very simple starting example, following these steps.

1. Download the file index.html from this project
1. Download the file http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/js/reveal.js and put it in the same directory as index.html
1. Download the file http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/css/theme/black.css and put it in the same directory as index.html
1. Download the file http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/css/reveal.css and put it in the same directory as index.html
1. Open index.html in a browser- you should see a very basic slideshow
1. Open index.html in an editor, find the comment <!-- Any section element inside of this container is displayed as a slide --> and start adding HTML content within the section tags, using the demo content as a guide.
1. Bored with the theme and want a better theme? Want more features or more examples? Check out http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/ !
